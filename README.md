Octopress Grain Theme
=====================

This is a port of Octopress blogging theme for Grain framework.

Features
========

Octopress theme out of the box provides all the necessary features and tools to instantly start blogging,
implement custom pages and organize posts. Moreover, it offers the same site structure as original Octoperess to
ensure simple and painless migration.

The latest version of the theme comes with:

  - integration with social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, GitHub, etc.
  - various content formatting tools to easily customize blog content
  - built-in atom news feed

Commands
--------

The theme ships with a few handy commands that allow to create new pages and posts:

``` sh:nl
./grainw create-page "/portfolio" "Portfolio" # adds 'Portfolio' page to a blog
```

``` sh:nl
./grainw create-post "Post Sample" # adds new post 'Post Sample'
```

Customization
-------------

Theme configuration settings allow to change a blog name, meta information, the number of posts per page,
set sharing options and rearrange sidebar sections.

At this time, the theme ships with the next sidebar modules:

  - **recent_posts** - shows the latest posts
  - **tweets** - shows the most recent tweets
  - **github** - displays links to GitHub repositories
  - **pinboard** and **delicious** - show recent Pinboard and Delicious bookmarks
  - **google_plus**, **facebook**, **twitter** and **instagram** - render links to social networks

Tag Library
-----------

Theme's tag library provides content formatting features similar to Octopress [plugins][plugins].

Currently, the following tags are available to use:

  - **blockquote** - renders a block quote with quote text, author and source
  - **pullquote** - renders a *HTML5 + CSS* pull quote
  - **img** - embeds an image into a page

Contributing
============

Any person or company wanting to contribute to this project should follow
the following rules in order to their contribution being accepted.

Sign your Work
--------------

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits.  This
certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to
submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be
accepted.

To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when
committing your changes:

    $ git commit -s -m "Adding a new widget driver for cogs."

This will append the following to your commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>

By doing this you certify the below:

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

If you wish to add the signoff to the commit message on your every commit
without the need to specify -s or --signoff, rename
.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample to .git/hooks/commit-msg and uncomment the lines:

``` sh
SOB=$(git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT | sed -n 's/^\(.*>\).*$/Signed-off-by: \1/p')
grep -qs "^$SOB" "$1" || echo "$SOB" >> "$1"
```
