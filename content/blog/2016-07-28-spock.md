 -summary: "We will try to examine current state of the automated testing concept in the Java world. As a reference, we will go through basic and advanced spock-framework features and compare them with what JUnit4/JUnit5/TestNG/Hamcrest/AssertJ/Mockito/whatever can offer instead. We will try to understand Spock philosophy and find out both pragmatic and emotional answer to the questions: should I use spock-framework in the year of 2016? how to convince my manager that 'yes, we should'? how to convince my teammates that 'no, we shouldnâ€™t'?"
