First option I considered when I decided to start up this blog was to use static site generator and Jekyll as the most popular one was an obvious option.
Shortly after I was ready with the first version of this blog and first post - link:${r '/blog/2017-02-20-jekyll-githubpages-asciidoc.adoc'}['Using Jekyll, Asciidoctor and GitHub Pages for static site creation', window="_blank"], I've noticed a link in link:https://twitter.com/sdelamo[@sdelamo, window="_blank"] link:http://groovycalamari.com/issues/68[Groovy Calamary #68, window="_blank"] to the static site generator from Groovy world - link:https://sysgears.com/grain/[Grain, window="_blank"].
As I consider myself as a Groovy ecosystem fan, I could not resist it and quickly migrated this blog to Grain.

== Service site generators

Typical web resource after you request a page from it, does something like following:

. fetch some data from storage
. process it
. select one of web page templates and render it
. return result

Many of them do not require dedicated data storage or data itself is changing relatively rarely.
It means that web pages can be generated once and served without no additional processing for every request.

It's very important that we should not return to the boring Web 1.0 world.
If client state on your site is not persisted, it can be handled by JavaScript locally.
If content is changing relatively rarely, you can just redeploy it with every change.
If you need something like commenting feature, you can rely on external resources (for example link:https://disqus.com[disqus.com, window="_blank"] in this case).

And if you get rid of all heavy dynamic weapons like databases and server-side code and express your site as a collection of HMTL, CSS and JavaScript files you can gain some very worthy benefits: ease of site deployment, content caching and delivering (which leads to better performance) and security management.

Typical static site generator takes your content (it can be plain text file, markdown, asciidoc, etc.) along with bunch of configuration parameters and the desired layout (usually HTML with some kind of template DSL) and transform them into a collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files ready for deployment and servicing as a static web resource.
According to link:https://www.staticgen.com/[staticgen.com, window="_blank"], there are dozens of different static sites generators and link:https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll, window="_blank"] is the most popular from them.
I've already posted an link:${r '/blog/2017-02-20-jekyll-githubpages-asciidoc.adoc'}[article, window="_blank"] about Jekyll, and today we will look closely at link:https://sysgears.com/grain/[Grain, window="_blank"], which is actually a workhorse of this blog itself.

== So, Grain

Grain is an open source static website generator for Groovy.
It provides all usual static site generator features and moreover has a very specific killer feature - Groovy is a privileged citizen for all kinds of source files (configuration, layout, content and more).

Starting Grain blog is as easy as downloading one of its link:https://sysgears.com/grain/themes/[themes, window="_blank"].
Let's examine it with yet another blog example, which means link:https://sysgears.com/grain/themes/octopress/[Grain Octopress Theme, window="_blank"] is theme of our choice.
To ensure everything is working open your project directory and execute following:

++++
${gist id:'8287efd2bfe42acdd125578282e0ab2f'}
++++

If you open now link:http://localhost:4000[http://localhost:4000, window="_blank"], you should see following:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/3600d.png'}[]

== Now some housekeeping

Before start actually using Grain, you need to perform some housekeeping.
For example, as Grain try to rely on Groovy ecosystem tool as much as possible, it uses Gradle as build tool.
But distribution that we've just download uses version 1.8 of Gradle wrapper (for the moment of writing this article 4.0 is actual version).
You can easily update it by applying following change to __build.gradle__ file:

++++
${gist id:'ad77d1f1c747791a37491d7cdaf6125c'}
++++

And running following command:

++++
${gist id:'d44849eee1050307969f218b29a7b869'}
++++

Also, it would be great to update __.gitignore__ file to ignore irrelevant for VCS files as following:

++++
${gist id:'67f0c7aae6a9299f3d58c15415078f21'}
++++

You should also fix JVM memory configuration in __grainw__ files:

++++
${gist id:'a27c146412d4d6abcbde9331d312c9af'}
++++

Modern web requires you to serve all your site content over HTTPS protocol.
By default not all Grain Octopress Theme content complies it.
You should edit file __theme/includes/custom/head.html__ as following:

++++
${gist id:'365b888e528ddeca13604ac1a492df87'}
++++

== Adding new post

The first thing you probably want to do with your blog is to create a new post.
To do it, add file named __yyyy-mm-dd-new-post.adoc__ (substitute yyyy-mm-dd with publication date and new-post with short post name) with following content:

++++
${gist id:'57ddf7f0300c32ccc937783f565d2b9b'}
++++

As you can see, another great thing about Grain is that it supports link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[Asciidoc, window="_blank"] format out-of-the-box.
It's a great benefit if your blog is going to be developer-oriented, and you probably may not be satisfied with using neither markdown nor HTML for your posts.
Asciidoc shares the same concept as link:http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown, window="_blank"], is partially compatible with it, but has much more powerful features needed for advanced drafting of articles, technical manuals, books, presentations, and prose.

Now your blog should look like following:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/8020f.png'}[]

And if you follow new post link:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/cf787.png'}[]

As I said in the beginning, Groovy is a privileged citizen in the Grain world.
To prove it, in the following sections I will demonstrate simple examples how you can use Groovy in all kinds of site sources - configuration, layout, content and even deployment.

== Site configuration

As you can see, there are plenty of defaults used by your blog now.
This problem is easily fixed via __SiteConfig.groovy__ file.
What is important, is that it is implemented as executable Groovy script, which constructs site build context.
Inside it you can:

- assign primitive values to configuration parameters

++++
${gist id:'df26ecc1e8cf0635e4e9eba6d94c0b86'}
++++

- use special Groovy literals like patters, string templates or lists

++++
${gist id:'1aa616b0e89a9c1c858e6d96bb94f0c6'}
++++

- instantiate objects and execute methods on them

++++
${gist id:'9763624cf6becc9be3b5afce43b073fd'}
++++

- use Groovy builders for hierarchical parameters

++++
${gist id:'6d4ceea06cb9ab146ad5ed1191216a82'}
++++

You can find tons of parameters there and even introduce your own.
For the beginning, let's concentrate on the simple ones and perform following changes:

++++
${gist id:'e36aa454a84fa42563ae9cf9689abc8d'}
++++

Now, your blog should look a little bit more personal:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/0cc17.png'}[]

Moreover, you can use special ``commands`` object to create custom commands for grain cli.

++++
${gist id:'83914dd6bc422569d7ecb9ef21ebfb30'}
++++

It means that if you execute `./grainw create-post 'HOWTO: create post from CLI'`` you will got following result:

++++
${gist id:'a1d47cfc42df32c2294bfd6392bf3b00'}
++++

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/ee478.png'}[]

== Site layout

Grain has a pretty usual layout system.
Let's explore it using example of __theme/layouts/blog.html__ which controls layout of site home page.

++++
${gist id:'d31cd182f6ebd74926fae55e4fb4e0ac'}
++++

On the lines 1-5, you can see typical page front matter.
First of all, it configures layout inheritance.
You can open file named __theme/layouts/default.html__, which is parent layout for __blog.html__ and check that  __blog.html__ content will be put inside ``{ content }`` tag (line 14) of __default.html__:

++++
${gist id:'472a52e4be5bbfab967715a2d8d90cca'}
++++

Following lines of front matter are passed into special ``page`` object and can be used to parametrize layout behavior.

After front matter we see kind of usual HTML code with addition of Groovy.
It can be one-liner, just like in lines 19 and 36.
In these concrete example special implicit method ``include`` is used, which takes another HTML file and optionally parameters map, renders their content and insert into original page.

More sophisticated option is multi-line Groovy code, which is, however, very natural and clear.
You can use ``if`` statement (like in line 8) to control which parts of page layout should be rendered and which not.
As a result you do not need any special constructions like many other static site generators has.
For example, if you need to render collection of elements, you can use Groovy Collection API like in line 16.

With such approach you can easily implement some very interesting features like in line 17, where you loop through list of blog posts, render content of each one, extract briefs and put them on your home page.

== Site content

Just like with layout files you can simply put any Groovy code anywhere in your content file.
For example, if you modify latest generated post as following:

++++
${gist id:'42639e6e2d6157fc54c71314a5bcfd98'}
++++

You will get something like:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/05279.png'}[]

Pay attention that this code will be executed once and its result will be put into static HTML page.
If you need dynamic behavior you will probable need something like:

++++
${gist id:'ac9904062cbeb91196034b423e4c1247'}
++++

If you need to reuse some code in multiple places, there is a nice feature called code custom tags in Grain.
If you have an experience with template frameworks like JSP, you can find something familiar in it.
As reference, open file __\theme\src\com\sysgears\octopress\taglibs\OctopressTagLib.groovy__ which already contains several very useful tags like ``gist`` or ``img``.
As you can see, custom tag is as simple as Groovy closure and HTML template, so we can implement our own in 3 minutes.

First, add following closure to __\theme\src\com\sysgears\octopress\taglibs\OctopressTagLib.groovy__:

++++
${gist id:'4abbf385d08118452dd25162ca42986e'}
++++

Then, create new file __\theme\includes\tags\dateMessage.html__ with following content:

++++
${gist id:'f799a454c3be0d07fc44cced4f41c0be'}
++++

And last, modify your content page:

++++
${gist id:'c7e583fa6da4ca837114094ba408f73a'}
++++

Ready! You will get something like:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/22b63.png'}[]

== Deployment to GitHub Pages

Now, it's time to finalize all our efforts and publish results of our work to the internet.
It can be achieved easily with support of link:https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages, window="_blank"] - web platform that serves static content from GitHub repositories.
If you put some static resources to your repository branch named __gh-pages__ GitHub Pages, will automatically serve it as web resource.

So, first obvious option is to run ``./grainw generate`` and push content of __dist__ folder to the __gh-pages__ branch of your repository.

But this option is really boring.
Let's rather set up automatic pipeline: link:https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI job, window="_blank"] which will be started automatically by each commit to __develop__ branch, and actually do the same: run ``./grainw generate`` and push content of __dist__ folder to the __gh-pages__ branch from the same repository.

First thing we need to do - generate key pair, so Travis job will be able to push to your repository - just run ``ssh-keygen -t rsa``.
Then, go to link:https://github.com/settings/keys[GitHub settings page, window="_blank"], and register public part of generated key.

Next, create file __.travis.yml__ to configure Travis job with following content:

++++
${gist id:'06601cf711422ecc791d3cd85c5cc3c0'}
++++

Don't forget to enable your repository build at link:https://travis-ci.org/profile/[Travis dashboard, window="_blank"].

As you can see, Travis is supposed to take private part of your generated key from __.travis/__ directory.
But surely it's not safe to really put is there.
Luckily enough, Travis supports file encryption.
You just need to run following command ``travis encrypt-file .travis/id_rsa --add``.
But it's important to know two tweaks regarding this command: first, be careful enough to commit encrypted file __id_rsa.enc__ instead of original __.travis/id_rsa__ and second - this command does not work on Windows boxes, you need a *nix one.

As you can see, there is almost no manual scripting of interaction with git in job definition.
The reason is that grain has special ``grainw deploy`` command which will invoke __\theme\src\com\sysgears\octopress\deploy\GHPagesDeployer.groovy__ script.
It works fine with manual deployment process, but needs some improvements to integrate fine with Travis.
You can take desired code here:

++++
${gist id:'ed573c2c93e1ed69d6a9c552a7cf8898'}
++++

__GHPagesDeployer__ script is instantiated in __SiteConfig__ script we already seen.
You need to configure it, by providing one parameter in __SiteConfig.groovy__ file:

++++
${gist id:'f5f2d9d09a9f52a842e25517f963be01'}
++++

Last thing you should do is go to the setting of your Travis job and enable __Build only if .travis.yml is present__ to prevent its running from __gh-pages__ branch.
Not you can push your latest changes to GitHub and watch how they will be processed by Travis job.

If you've done everything correct, you should get the same result as I have here - https://yermilov.github.io/grain-example/.
