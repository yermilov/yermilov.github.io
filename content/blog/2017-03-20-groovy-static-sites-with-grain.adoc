First option I considered when I decided to start up this blog was to use static site generator and Jekyll as the most popular one was an obvious option.
Shortly after I was ready with the first version of this blog and first post - link:${r '/blog/2017-02-20-jekyll-githubpages-asciidoc.adoc'}['Using Jekyll, Asciidoctor and GitHub Pages for static site creation', window="_blank"], I've noticed a link in link:https://twitter.com/sdelamo[@sdelamo, window="_blank"] link:http://groovycalamari.com/issues/68[Groovy Calamary #68, window="_blank"] to the static site generator from Groovy world - link:https://sysgears.com/grain/[Grain, window="_blank"].
As I consider myself as a Groovy ecosystem fan, I could not resist it and quickly migrated this blog to Grain.

== Why static matters?

Typical web resource after you request a page from it, does something like following:

. fetch some data from storage
. process it
. select one of web page templates and render it
. return result

Many of them do not require dedicated data storage or data itself is changing relatively rarely.
It means that web pages can be generated once and served without no additional processing for every request.

It's very important that we should not return to the boring Web 1.0 world.
If client state on your site is not persisted, it can be handled by JavaScript locally.
If content is changing relatively rarely, you can just redeploy it with every change.
If you need something like commenting feature, you can rely on external resources (for example link:https://disqus.com[disqus.com, window="_blank"] in this case).

And if you get rid of all heavy dynamic weapons like databases and server-side code and express your site as a collection of HMTL, CSS and JavaScript files you can gain some very worthy benefits: ease of site deployment, content caching and delivering (which leads to better performance) and security management.

== Service site generators

Typical static site generator takes your content (it can be plain text file, markdown, asciidoc, etc.) along with bunch of configuration parameters and the desired layout (usually HTML with some kind of template DSL) and transform them into a collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files ready for deployment and servicing as a static web resource.
According to link:https://www.staticgen.com/[staticgen.com, window="_blank"], there are dozens of different static sites generators and link:https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll, window="_blank"] is the most popular from them.
I've already posted an link:${r '/blog/2017-02-20-jekyll-githubpages-asciidoc.adoc'}[article, window="_blank"] about Jekyll, and today we will look closely at link:https://sysgears.com/grain/[Grain, window="_blank"], which is actually a workhorse of this blog itself.

== So, Grain

Grain is an open source static website generator for Groovy.
It provides all usual static site generator features and moreover has a very specific killer feature - Groovy is a privileged citizen for all kinds of source files (configuration, layout, content and more).

Starting Grain blog is as easy as downloading one of its link:https://sysgears.com/grain/themes/[themes, window="_blank"].
Let's examine it with yet another blog example, which means link:https://sysgears.com/grain/themes/octopress/[Grain Octopress Theme, window="_blank"] is theme of our choice.
To ensure everything is working open your project directory and execute following:

++++
${gist id:'8287efd2bfe42acdd125578282e0ab2f'}
++++

If you open now link:http://localhost:4000[http://localhost:4000, window="_blank"], you should see following:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/3600d.png'}[]

== Now some housekeeping

Before start actually using Grain, you need to perform some housekeeping.
For example, as Grain try to rely on Groovy ecosystem tool as much as possible, it uses Gradle as build tool.
But distribution that we've just download uses version 1.8 of Gradle wrapper (for the moment of writing this article 4.0 is actual version).
You can easily update it by applying following change to __build.gradle__ file:

++++
${gist id:'ad77d1f1c747791a37491d7cdaf6125c'}
++++

And running following command:

++++
${gist id:'d44849eee1050307969f218b29a7b869'}
++++

Also, it would be great to update __.gitignore__ file to ignore irrelevant for VCS files as following:

++++
${gist id:'67f0c7aae6a9299f3d58c15415078f21'}
++++

You should also fix JVM memory configuration in __grainw__ files:

++++
${gist id:'a27c146412d4d6abcbde9331d312c9af'}
++++

Modern web requires you to serve all your site content over HTTPS protocol.
By default not all Grain Octopress Theme content complies it.
You should edit file __theme/includes/custom/head.html__ as following:

++++
${gist id:'365b888e528ddeca13604ac1a492df87'}
++++

== Adding new post

The first thing you probably want to do with your blog is to create a new post.
To do it, add file named __yyyy-mm-dd-new-post.adoc__ (substitute yyyy-mm-dd with publication date and new-post with short post name) with following content:

++++
${gist id:'57ddf7f0300c32ccc937783f565d2b9b'}
++++

As you can see, another great thing about Grain is that it supports link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[Asciidoc, window="_blank"] format out-of-the-box.
It's a great benefit if your blog is going to be developer-oriented, and you probably may not be satisfied with using neither markdown nor HTML for your posts.
Asciidoc shares the same concept as link:http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown, window="_blank"], is partially compatible with it, but has much more powerful features needed for advanced drafting of articles, technical manuals, books, presentations, and prose.

Now your blog should look like following:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/8020f.png'}[]

And if you follow new post link:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/cf787.png'}[]

As I said in the beginning, Groovy is a privileged citizen in the Grain world.
To prove it, in the following sections I will demonstrate simple examples how you can use Groovy in all kinds of site sources - configuration, layout, content and even deployment.

== Site configuration

As you can see, there are plenty of defaults used by your blog now.
This problem is easily fixed via __SiteConfig.groovy__ file.
What is important, is that it is implemented as executable Groovy script, which constructs site build context.
Inside it you can:

- assign primitive values to configuration parameters

++++
${gist id:'df26ecc1e8cf0635e4e9eba6d94c0b86'}
++++

- use special Groovy literals like patters, string templates or lists

++++
${gist id:'1aa616b0e89a9c1c858e6d96bb94f0c6'}
++++

- instantiate objects and execute methods on them

++++
${gist id:'9763624cf6becc9be3b5afce43b073fd'}
++++

- use Groovy builders for hierarchical parameters

++++
${gist id:'6d4ceea06cb9ab146ad5ed1191216a82'}
++++

You can find tons of parameters there and even introduce your own.
For the beginning, let's concentrate on the simple ones and perform following changes:

++++
${gist id:'e36aa454a84fa42563ae9cf9689abc8d'}
++++

Now, your blog should look a little bit more personal:

image::${r '/images/2017-03-20-groovy-static-sites-with-grain/0cc17.png'}[]

Moreover, you can use special ``commands`` object to create custom commands for grain cli.

++++
${gist id:'83914dd6bc422569d7ecb9ef21ebfb30'}
++++

It means that if you execute `./grainw create-post 'HOWTO: create post from CLI'`` you will got following result:

++++
${gist id:'a1d47cfc42df32c2294bfd6392bf3b00'}
++++
